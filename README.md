# Data Visualization of Sleep Disorder Dataset

This program visualizes the distribution of gender (male, female) among different ages and the number of patients in a sleep disorder dataset. It involves data handling using Pandas and visualization using Matplotlib.

## Steps

1. **Data Import:** The sleep disorder dataset is imported and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Checked for any null values in the dataset.

3. **Data Extraction:** The age and gender columns are extracted for analysis.
4. **Data Visualization:**
- A bar chart is created to visualize the distribution of gender across different ages.
- The number of patients is also visualized to provide insights into the distribution of sleep disorders among different age groups.
## Libraries Used

- **Pandas:** For data handling and preprocessing.

- **Matplotlib:** For visualizing the data in the form of bar charts.
## Conclusion

This visualization helps in understanding the distribution of sleep disorders across different genders and age groups, providing valuable insights into potential patterns and trends.
